# Comparative-Performance-of-Predictive-Models

The notebook contains an implementation of four predictive models; Linear Regression, Ridge regression, Random Forests for regression and Gradient Tree Boosting for regression. The models are implemented individually and their performance is obtained. The models are then implemented in combination with each other (a binary classification followed by a regression).

#**Implementation Notes**

1. The Database used was collected and provided as a csv file. no work has been done within the project to obtain the data from an open source.
2. Where implementation of techniques was computationally impractical, alternative work was done to complete the predictive models. This is seen in the Random Forests and Gradient Tree models for regression where obtaining the best hyperparameters took significant amounts of time and so implementations without gradient boosting were used.
